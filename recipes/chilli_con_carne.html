            <p>
                Chilli con carne is a hearty, spicy stew that originated in Texan and Mexican culinary traditions.
                The dish typically features ground or diced beef simmered with tomatoes, kidney beans, onions, garlic,
                and a blend of spices like cumin, paprika, and chili powder.
                It's known for its bold flavor and satisfying texture, making it a favorite comfort food in many
                households.

                While traditional recipes focus on beef, variations now include turkey, pork, or even plant-based
                alternatives for vegetarian versions.
                Chilli con carne is often served with rice, cornbread, or tortilla chips, and garnished with sour cream,
                cheese, or fresh herbs.
                Its versatility and rich taste have helped it gain popularity around the world.
