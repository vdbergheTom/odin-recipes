        <h2>Perfect marriage of tomato and basil</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Tomato basil soup is a classic, comforting dish that combines the rich acidity of ripe tomatoes with the
                fresh, aromatic flavor of basil. Often served as a starter, it’s warm, smooth, and deeply
                satisfying—perfect for cozy evenings or a light, elegant appetizer. A touch of garlic and onion adds
                depth, while a swirl of cream can elevate it to a more luxurious texture.</p>
            <p>This soup is also incredibly versatile. It pairs beautifully with grilled cheese sandwiches, crusty
                bread, or a simple green salad. Whether blended until silky or left slightly chunky, tomato basil soup
                is both easy to prepare and impressive to serve, making it a staple in kitchens around the world.</p>
